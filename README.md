## Tech Details

* Cypress - Self proclaiming E2E test framework. Designed to keep UI tests simple and reliable. https://www.cypress.io/
* Time Travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
* Automatic Waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests.
* Screenshots and Videos: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.
* Cross browser Testing
* Cypress processes respond to the applicationâ€™s events and processes command in real-time. With real-time reloads in Cypress, tests are reloaded
automatically as and when changes are made in the app.
